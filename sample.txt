This is an application filed by the applicant for recovery of possession of the suit premises and rent, and order for mesne profits and costs. 
At the conclusion of the trial on 4 February 2019, I ordered that the respondent do deliver vacant possession of the suit premises to the applicant, do pay the applicant arrears of rent / mesne profits and cost, but subject to a relief until 18 February 2019, with reasons to be handed down in writing.  I now do so.
The applicant filed the application on 24 October 2018, stating that there is a tenancy between the parties for 2 years from 1 June 2018 at monthly rent of $20,000, and the respondent failed to pay rent from 1 October 2018. 
In addition, there was a shortfall of rent payment in the sum of $200 for the period from 1 August 2018 to 30 September 2018. 
The respondent filed a Notice of Opposition on 29 October 2018 and stated that he had already paid full amount of monthly rent at $20,000 in both August and September 2018 respectively.  
The respondent alleged that the applicant had provided wrong information to the tribunal, had refused to pay repair costs previously incurred by him, had hidden relevant facts in the application including structural defects and had delivered the suit premises to him with faults.  
He further alleged that the applicant had refused to care for structural repair and fair wear and tear of the suit premises, which are the duties of the landlord, and the suit premises were then about 40% uninhabitable.  
He also mentioned about harassment, discrimination and fraud, and that the applicant had not signed on the tenancy agreement in person.
At the call-over hearing on 7 December 2018, there was no dispute between the parties that the respondent had not made any actual payment of rent from 1 October 2018.  
The respondent mentioned a number of facts and issues, and submitted that his loss and costs were greater than the rents as claimed by the applicant, and therefore could support him not to pay rent from 1 October 2018.  
In the circumstances, I directed the parties to file witness(es) statement(s), and fixed a further call-over hearing on 11 January 2019.  
I also ordered the respondent to pay into the tribunal interim payments in the total sum of $80,000 respectively on 17 December 2018 and 2 January 2019, being the interim rent / mesne profits from 1 October 2018 to 31 January 2019, which would be kept in the tribunal until further order.
On 17 December 2018, the respondent filed an application to review the decision made on 7 December 2018.  
He asked to (1) change the trial judge / member because the applicant and I have the same surname, (2) defer the deadline for filing of supplemental witness statement for a week because he would be travelling in Christmas, and (3) reschedule the further call-over hearing to a later date.  
Further, since he considered that the applicant had confiscated the deposit, the suit premises were then uninhabitable, and his loss and expenses were high, he disagreed to make payments to the tribunal which covered a period prior to the last hearing.  
The applicant replied on 20 December 2018 and objected to the review.  
I decided on 20 December 2018 not to review the decision made on 7 December 2018.
On 10 January 2019, the respondent filed an interlocutory application and asked for leave to file supplemental witness statement out of time.  
At the further call-over hearing on 11 January 2019, I granted leave to the respondent to file supplement witness statement by 14 January 2019 and then fix the trial on 4 February 2019.  
Since the respondent had not made the interim payments as ordered on 7 December 2018, I ordered the respondent to make interim payment in the sum of $80,000 again on or before 14 January 2019.
